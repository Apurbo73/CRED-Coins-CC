### CRED Coins CC:

In this program, for each test case, Chef pays Y bills using CRED, and for each bill he earns X CRED coins. So the total number of coins Chef earns is X * Y. Since each bag at the CodeChef store costs 100 CRED coins, we calculate how many full bags Chef can buy by dividing the total coins by 100 using integer division (totalCoins / 100).

The program first reads the number of test cases T, and then for each test case, reads the values of X and Y. It computes the total coins and determines how many bags Chef can afford. The result is printed for each test case, one per line.
